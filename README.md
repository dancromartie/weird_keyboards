# weird_keyboards
weird javascript keyboards.  mostly for psychological testing.  mostly jsfiddles?

# Why?
Why do we type the way we do?  Are there other ways to go about it?  A lot of
it is historical, and these are thought experiments that go against that...
With these in mind, it seems like whoever made our rules did a pretty good job!

It's also a reminder to me of how easy it is to memorize what seems like a
daunting amount of knowledge if you just practice for a while. Some of these
only take a handful of minutes to memorize.

### 4 Finger Timing Based Keyboard ###
Demo at http://jsfiddle.net/csyykgct/4/

This keyboard only uses keys d, f, k and j. You use many keys struck within
200ms to enter other letters.

For example, fdjkjdfkjdff types "hello", but only if typed with proper timing.

Key mappings are intentionally weird and nonsensical, though shorter
combinations of letters are given to vowels.

If you've every played drums, particularly quads/tenor drums, I bet these will
stick much easier.  It's fairly analgous to various rudiments.
